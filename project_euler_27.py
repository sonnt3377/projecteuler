    Project Euler 27: Quadratic primes

    Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: n^2 + n + 41
    It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 <= n <= 39.
    However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41,
    and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

    The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for
    the consecutive values 0 <= n <= 79. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.

    Considering quadratics of the form: n^2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| <= 1000
    where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11| = 11 and |âˆ’4| = 4

    Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum
    number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
